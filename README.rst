Why Fork?
======================================
This is my fork of RLPy.
Since the PyPI version of RLPy is not compatible with the latest numpy C-API,
I forked the repo and am building ManyLinux wheels on Azure.


Original README: RLPy - Reinforment Learning Framework
=======================================================

RLPy is a framework to conduct sequential decision making experiments. The
current focus of this project lies on value-function-based reinforcement
learning. The project is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD License.
